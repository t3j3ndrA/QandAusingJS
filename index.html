                We have developed our social skills when “outdoor social relations” were part of
                our everyday life. What can parents do for their kids to develop her/his social skills when they are
                locked in their homes because of pandemic virus? Will setting up little group performances help
                coordinating with other people and closely experiencing "living in society"??

                'Everyday life peacebuilding' is emerging as a formal field of study within the
                multidisciplinary field of peace and conflict research; it is more typically addressed by sociologists,

                Learning has several meanings. However, one of the explanations/theories is "Learning happens when there
                is a change in behaviour". I think this is true and most authorities in education support this view.
